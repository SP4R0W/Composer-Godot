# Composer

A lightweight scene manager library for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), written in C#, with a mere 20 KB footprint. It boasts robust efficiency and cross-language scripting capabilities, supporting both 2D and 3D environments.\
This library excels in loading scenes [asynchronously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)), facilitating the implementation of dynamic loading screens, smooth transitions and other features.

## üßæ Prerequisites

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 4.2 (.NET version)
- [.NET](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html#prerequisites) SDK 

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

- Download the `Composer` folder as .ZIP or from the releases tab
- Extract it into your project folder
- [Autoload](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.html) `Composer.cs` and if you plan to use it from `.gd` files, autoload `ComposerGD.cs` as well

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
Disclaimer: If you're using Composer from gdscript files, just change `Composer.` with `ComposerGD.` unless stated otherwise
### Scene Creation
**Method 1:**\
First, add a reference name and path to the *Manifest*.
```
Composer.AddScene("MyScene", "res://path/to/MyScene")
```

We then create it.
```
Composer.CreateScene("MyScene")
```

**Method 2:**\
We can add scenes and create them instantly using *SceneSettings* without needing to call `CreateScene()`

C#:
```
Composer.AddScene("MyScene", "res://path/to/MyScene", new(){
    InstantCreate = true,
})
```
